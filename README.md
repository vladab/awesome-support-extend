Extending Awesome Support Plugin 

– Pagination for tickets in the front-end;

– Assignee filter in WP Admin back-end;

– Filter by client name (ability to see all his open tickets);

– Front-end search within tickets (the best would be to have an AJAX search) - by name, content and direct search by ticket number;

– Ability for people to see and read other people tickets (it's better to allow to see only closed, but as a first solution we can show even open tickets);

- Enable to edit other users tickets by administrator(Useful when a user sends you account information that you don't want to be available publicly )
